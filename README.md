# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Install dependencies
To install all the dependencies:
```bash 
npm install
```
To ignore the folder in which dependencies were installed:
```
create a .gitignore file and type:
node_modules/*
```

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```bash 
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```bash 
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

npm run cypress:run
```

## Tutorial: Basics
Pull changes into your own branch:
```bash
# Select the dev branch
git checkout dev
# Pull latest changes made on dev branch
git pull
# Select your own branch
git checkout <branch_name>
# Merge the updated dev branch into your own
git merge dev
```

Create pull request:
```bash

```

### Tutorial: Testing
Now, I have created two exemplary tests inside their respective folders. Studying these along with the following testing tutorial should be a good starting point to create your own tests :)  

Run the backend tests:
```bash
# 1.Create your own test file inside the:
cd tests 
# folder. (don't forget to name it as follows: <branch_name>backend.test.js)
# 2.Write your tests
# 3.Run the testing script
npm run ava
```
Run the frontend tests:
```bash
# 1.Create your own test file inside the:
cd cypress/e2e/
# cypress folder. (don't forget to name it as follows: <branch_name>frontend.cy.js)
# 2.Write your tests
# 3.Run the server on a separate terminal using
npm start
# 4.Run the testing script
npm run cypress:open
# Navigate to the test you wrote from inside the cypress gui
# browser -> e2e -> test.cy.js
```
